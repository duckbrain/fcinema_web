##Colaborate

If you want to help us making fcinema's site better, fork the project, change whatever you want, and make a pull request to our development branch. However, it will be better if you first contact with [Ricardo Garc√≠a][link2], in order to see if that change is necessary. Also, by getting in touch, and if you want, we will add you to our [Trello board][link3]
